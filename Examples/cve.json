When this             happens, the ByteBuffer containing the HTTP response headers is             released back to the ByteBufferPool twice.

Thread1 then             proceeds to write the buffer that now contains different data.

On Unix like systems, the system's temporary             directory is shared between all users on that system. Because of             this, when files and directories are written into this directory             they are, by default, readable by other users on that same system.             This vulnerability does not allow other users to overwrite the             contents of these directories or files. This is purely an             information disclosure vulnerability. This vulnerability impacts             you if the JUnit tests write sensitive information, like API keys             or passwords, into the temporary folder, and the JUnit tests             execute in an environment where the OS has other untrusted users.             Because certain JDK file system APIs were only added in JDK 1.7,             this this fix is dependent upon the version of the JDK you are             using. For Java 1.7 and higher users: this vulnerability is fixed             in 4.13.1. For Java 1.6 and lower users: no patch is available, you              must use the workaround below. If you are unable to patch, or are             stuck running on Java 1.6, specifying the `java.io.tmpdir` system             environment variable to a directory that is exclusively owned by             the executing user will fix this vulnerability.

      "description": "Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven             network application framework for rapid development of maintainable              high performance protocol servers & clients. In Netty before             version 4.1.59.Final there is a vulnerability on Unix-like systems             involving an insecure temp file. When netty's multipart decoders             are used local information disclosure can occur via the local             system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk              is enabled. On unix-like systems, the temporary directory is shared              between all user. As such, writing to this directory using APIs             that do not explicitly set the file/directory permissions can lead             to information disclosure. Of note, this does not impact modern             MacOS Operating Systems. The method \"File.createTempFile\" on             unix-like systems creates a random file, but, by default will             create this file with the permissions \"-rw-r--r--\". Thus, if             sensitive information is written to this file, other local users             can read this information. This is the case in netty's             \"AbstractDiskHttpData\" is vulnerable. This has been fixed in             version 4.1.59.Final. As a workaround, one may specify your own             \"java.io.tmpdir\" when you start the JVM or use             \"DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...)\" to set the directory to             something that is only readable by the current user.",

To             exploit the vulnerability: 1) the attacker needs to have privileges              to control JDBC connection parameters; 2) and there should be a             vulnerable class (constructor with URL parameter and ability to             execute code) in the classpath. From Apache Calcite Avatica 1.22.0             onwards, it will be verified that the class implements the expected              interface before invoking its constructor.",

This happens even with the             default settings of `fileSizeThreshold=0` which should stream the             whole part content to disk. An attacker client may send a large             multipart request and cause the server to throw `OutOfMemoryError`.              However, the server may be able to recover after the             `OutOfMemoryError` and continue its service -- although it may take              some time. This issue has been patched in versions 9.4.51, 10.0.14,              and 11.0.14. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade             may set the multipart parameter `maxRequestSize` which must be set             to a non-negative value, so the whole multipart content is limited             (although still read into memory).",

      "description": "Jetty is a java based web server and servlet engine.              Nonstandard cookie parsing in Jetty may allow an attacker to             smuggle cookies within other cookies, or otherwise perform             unintended behavior by tampering with the cookie parsing mechanism.              If Jetty sees a cookie VALUE that starts with `\"` (double quote),             it will continue to read the cookie string until it sees a closing             quote -- even if a semicolon is encountered. So, a cookie header             such as: `DISPLAY_LANGUAGE=\"b; JSESSIONID=1337; c=d\"` will be             parsed as one cookie, with the name DISPLAY_LANGUAGE and a value of              b; JSESSIONID=1337; c=d instead of 3 separate cookies. This has             security implications because if, say, JSESSIONID is an HttpOnly             cookie, and the DISPLAY_LANGUAGE cookie value is rendered on the             page, an attacker can smuggle the JSESSIONID cookie into the             DISPLAY_LANGUAGE cookie and thereby exfiltrate it. This is             significant when an intermediary is enacting some policy based on             cookies, so a smuggled cookie can bypass that policy yet still be             seen by the Jetty server or its logging system. This issue has been              addressed in versions 9.4.51, 10.0.14, 11.0.14, and 12.0.0.beta0             and users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds             for this issue.",

The `SniHandler` can             allocate up to 16MB of heap for each channel during the TLS             handshake. When the handler or the channel does not have an idle             timeout, it can be used to make a TCP server using the `SniHandler`              to allocate 16MB of heap. The `SniHandler` class is a handler that             waits for the TLS handshake to configure a `SslHandler` according             to the indicated server name by the `ClientHello` record. For this             matter it allocates a `ByteBuf` using the value defined in the             `ClientHello` record. Normally the value of the packet should be             smaller than the handshake packet but there are not checks done             here and the way the code is written, it is possible to craft a             packet that makes the `SslClientHelloHandler`. This vulnerability             has been fixed in version 4.1.94.Final.",

In versions 11.0.0 through 11.0.15, 10.0.0 through             10.0.15, and 9.0.0 through 9.4.52, an integer overflow in             `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize` allows for HTTP/2 HPACK header values             to exceed their size limit. `MetaDataBuilder.java` determines if a             header name or value exceeds the size limit, and throws an             exception if the limit is exceeded. However, when length is very             large and huffman is true, the multiplication by 4 in line 295 will              overflow, and length will become negative. `(_size+length)` will             now be negative, and the check on line 296 will not be triggered.             Furthermore, `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize` allows for user-entered             HPACK header value sizes to be negative, potentially leading to a             very large buffer allocation later on when the user-entered size is              multiplied by 2. This means that if a user provides a negative             length value (or, more precisely, a length value which, when             multiplied by the 4/3 fudge factor, is negative), and this length             value is a very large positive number when multiplied by 2, then             the user can cause a very large buffer to be allocated on the             server. Users of HTTP/2 can be impacted by a remote denial of             service attack. The issue has been fixed in versions 11.0.16,             10.0.16, and 9.4.53. There are no known workarounds.",

Prior to versions 9.4.52, 10.0.16, 11.0.16, and 12.0.1, Jetty             accepts the `+` character proceeding the content-length value in a             HTTP/1 header field.
